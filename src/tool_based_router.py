USER QUERY: "{query}"

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
{tools_list}

YOUR TASK:
1. Identify ALL tools needed to answer this query
2. For each tool, specify:
   - Why it's needed
   - Priority (1.0 = critical, 0.5 = nice-to-have)
   - Specific query for that tool
   - Expected output
3. Determine if answer can be given directly or needs synthesis

EXAMPLES:

Query: "What time does Versailles open?"
‚Üí Tools: [schedule_api]
‚Üí Can answer directly: YES
‚Üí No synthesis needed

Query: "Where is the Hall of Mirrors?"
‚Üí Tools: [knowledge_base, google_maps]
‚Üí Can answer directly: NO (need to combine location info + directions)
‚Üí Needs synthesis: YES

Query: "Plan a rainy day visit with wheelchair access"
‚Üí Tools: [google_weather, accessibility_kb, knowledge_base, google_maps]
‚Üí Can answer directly: NO
‚Üí Needs synthesis: YES (complex planning)

Query: "Best restaurants near Versailles"
‚Üí Tools: [restaurant_api, google_maps]
‚Üí Can answer directly: NO (need to combine recommendations + distances)
‚Üí Needs synthesis: YES

IMPORTANT:
