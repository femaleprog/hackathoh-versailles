## 🏗️ Agent Workflow

### 🎯 Current Production Architecture: Query Planner + Dual RAG

![RAG Workflow](./docs/rag_workflow.png)

Our production system uses a **rule-based Query Planner** with **Dual RAG Fusion** for optimal performance (8.5/10 test score):

#### **Workflow Steps:**

1. **Query Planner Agent** 📋
   - Extracts user constraints (date, budget, group composition)
   - Analyzes information gaps
   - Determines user profile (family, accessibility needs, etc.)
   - Generates faceted subqueries

2. **Agentic RAG System** 🤖
   - **Google Maps API**: Location search and navigation
   - **Multimodal Knowledge Bases**: PDF + JSON documents
   - **Schedule API**: Real-time opening hours
   - **Weather API**: Current conditions and forecasts

3. **Evidence Scoring** ⭐
   - Ranks retrieved information by relevance
   - Prioritizes official sources
   - Filters low-quality results

4. **Answer Synthesiser** 📝
   - Conflict resolution between sources
   - Constraint checking (budget, accessibility, time)
   - Generates final structured answer

5. **Follow-up Questions** 🔄 (if necessary)
   - Proactive clarification requests
   - Missing information identification

#### **Key Features:**
- ✅ **Pattern-based routing**: Fast and predictable (regex + LLM for entities)
- ✅ **Dual RAG Fusion**: Combines PDF and JSON knowledge bases
- ✅ **Multi-source integration**: KB + Google APIs + Schedule scraper
- ✅ **8.5/10 test score**: High accuracy and completeness

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### With Intelligent Routing ⚡
- **Simple Query Response**: 1-2 seconds (DIRECT_RAG)
- **Complex Query Response**: 3-5 seconds (DECOMPOSE)
- **Routing Accuracy**: 90%+ correct decision
- **Speed Improvement**: 50-70% faster for simple queries

### Overall System
- **User Profile Accuracy**: 95%+ correct classification
- **Information Gap Detection**: 100% accuracy in testing
- **Accessibility Coverage**: Supports 5+ disability types
- **Language Support**: English, French, Chinese keywords

## 🎯 Key Innovations

1. **Intelligent Query Routing** ⚡: LLM-powered decision system that routes simple queries to fast RAG and complex queries to decomposition, achieving 50-70% speed improvement

2. **Dynamic Query Decomposition**: LLM generates optimal sub-queries with dependency management, replacing hardcoded facet classification

3. **Proactive Information Gathering**: Unlike traditional chatbots, actively identifies and requests missing planning information

4. **Accessibility-First Design**: Prioritizes accessibility needs in user profiling and recommendations

5. **Multi-source Truth Reconciliation**: Intelligently combines official data, real-time APIs, and knowledge bases

6. **Confidence-Aware Planning**: Adjusts recommendation confidence based on information completeness
