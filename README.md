- **Proactive Question Generation**: Suggests follow-up questions to optimize planning

### ♿ **Comprehensive Accessibility Support**
- **Multi-disability Recognition**: Supports wheelchair users, visual/hearing impaired, cognitive needs
- **Mobility Assessment**: Detects walking aids, rest frequency requirements
- **Specialized Recommendations**: Elevator access, accessible restrooms, tactile tours
- **Senior-friendly Planning**: Rest areas, reduced walking routes, seating options

### 🎯 **Faceted RAG Architecture**
- **Multi-source Knowledge Integration**: Official KB, real-time APIs, schedule data
- **Faceted Information Retrieval**: History, Family, Practical, Itinerary, Weather facets
- **Authority-weighted Scoring**: Prioritizes official sources over external data
- **Conflict Resolution**: Intelligent handling of contradictory information

### 🌐 **Real-time Data Integration**
- **Google Places API**: Location search and navigation
- **Google Weather API**: Current weather conditions and forecasts
- **Live Schedule Scraping**: Real-time opening hours and crowd levels
- **Route Optimization**: Walking directions between attractions

## 🎨 User Profile Detection

The system intelligently categorizes users based on their queries:

| Profile | Detection Criteria | Special Features |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Accessibility Needs** | Wheelchair, mobility aids, disabilities | Elevator routes, accessible facilities |
| **Family with Kids** | Children, family mentions | Child-friendly activities, safety tips |
| **Family with Elderly** | Mixed age groups | Rest areas, reduced walking |
| **Elderly Group** | Senior citizens, frequent rest needs | Seating, petit train tours |
| **Couple** | Two-person groups | Romantic spots, intimate experiences |
| **Group** | Large parties | Group activities, logistics |
| **Solo Traveler** | Individual visits | Flexible pacing, personal interests |

## 📊 Information Completeness System

The agent proactively identifies and requests missing information:

- **📅 Date Information**: Specific dates, seasons, day of week
- **👥 Group Composition**: Number of people, ages, special needs
- **⏰ Visit Duration**: Hours, half-day, full-day planning
- **💰 Budget Level**: Economic, standard, premium options

**Completeness Scoring**: 
- 100%: All key information provided
- 75%: One piece missing
- 50%: Two pieces missing
- 0%: Minimal information

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### **Core Components**

1. **Enhanced Query Planner** (`src/enhanced_planner.py`)
   - User constraint extraction
   - Profile determination
   - Subquery generation
